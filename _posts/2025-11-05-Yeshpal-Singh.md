## Abstract
Quantum technology is often categorised as quantum sensing & timing, quantum computing and quantum communication.  Atoms (in some cases molecules & quantum dots as well) and photons form the underpinning elements. Read outs in quantum experiments/devices are direct images, shadow image, number of particles (atoms/photons), frequency or phase measurements. Even in my group, we deal with atoms and photons, manipulated one with another in order to obtain the output we are interested in- be it ultra precise time, measurement of gravitational field, detection of birds and drones or quantum networks or just doing fundamental physics. 
 I assume that several of these detection techniques are directly transferable to medical science. Firstly I will briefly introduce Quantum Technology Programme in the UK, gradually transitioning to the examples of these techniques and their associated use cases. 


## Speaker Bio
Yeshpal Singh (YS) is Professor of Quantum Science and Innovation at University of Birmingham (UoB) and has performed world-leading research in ultracold atoms and mobile optical-lattice clocks. He led the world’s first transportable optical lattice clock setup which performs at the precision 3x10-18. He was short listed among top 10 candidates for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions Prizes 2017 within Innovation and Entrepreneurship category by the European Commission. He pioneered the idea of ‘quantum-enabled radars’ utilising unprecedented stability and ultralow phase-noise characteristics of quantum/optical clocks. He has been playing a key role in the UK National Quantum Technology Initiative right from start, since 2013. He has authored over 60 publications, 1 patent and his awards include from Royal Society, Birmingham Innovation Fellowship, and Marie-Curie Fellowship. He is a member of the core EU-science team working with ESA on the International space-station optical clock. For the School of Physics and Astronomy, he heads Impact & Innovation as well as organises the school colloquia. His group consists of 25 researchers and several experiments. His timing lab is dark fibre connected to National Physical Lab (Teddington), UK dark fibre facility, National Timing Centre and EU metrology institutes via EU fibre network.
