## Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is transforming the landscape of biomedical imaging by combining the rich spectroscopic contrast of light with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound. This powerful hybrid approach holds enormous potential for both preclinical research and clinical translation. A key step towards realising this potential lies in replacing bulky and costly laser systems with compact, affordable light sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs). These advances could make PA imaging more accessible and practical in clinical settings. In this seminar, I will share our recent progress in advancing LED-based PA imaging — from reducing noise and enhancing needle visualisation to correcting acoustic aberrations and optical fluence, paving the way towards more quantitative, reliable, and clinically deployable imaging solutions.

## Speaker Bio
Dr. Wenfeng Xia is a Reader in Biomedical Imaging and School Lead (International) at the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King’s College London. He leads the Photons+ Ultrasound Research Laboratory (PURL), which focuses on pioneering technologies that integrate light and sound to enhance surgical and interventional procedures.
Dr. Xia earned his BSc in Electrical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, MSc in Medical Physics from the University of Heidelberg, and PhD from the University of Twente. Prior to joining King’s, he was a Research Associate and later Senior Research Associate at University College London.
His research centers on photoacoustic imaging (optoacoustics) — a hybrid imaging technique that combines optical and ultrasound methods — with a strong emphasis on clinical translation and innovation in minimally invasive medical technologies.
